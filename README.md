# React Project setup

React redux setup inspired by https://github.com/wrick17/react-template. Project restructured for my workflow.

# HOW TO GET STARTED

clone the repo
```
npm install
```

for dev server:
```
npm start
```

for production stuff:
```
npm run build
node server.js
```

# READ BEFORE YOU START WORKING
* Make sure all your Components have Proptypes
* **One file** should contain **only ONE** component
* Use props where ever possible. **Do not copy everything into state**
* Use ES6 syntax as much as possible. They make your code more efficient and keeps it clean
* Maintain proper indentation and vertical gap in your code for proper readability and maintainability
* **Avoid inline coding** unless you are trying to survive a zombie apocalypse
